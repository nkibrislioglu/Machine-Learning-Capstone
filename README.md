## Project Motivation
When people choose a place they would like to live, they consider many attributes. web sites or applications used for real estate generally provides some information about the neighborhood like nearby schools and amenities. In this project, I aim to enhance customer experience by including the social environment of cities and providing a wider range of possibilities. By using this information, a real estate consultant may give additional advice and information to her customers.

Therefore, the purpose of this project is to make suggestions about the places people may like to live in. Moreover, they will have information about the rental prices of the possible lovable cities and the minimum cost of a place with certain attributes. 

In this project, I suggested alternative places to live for a person who likes to live in Natick, MA. For this specific purpose, my audience is people who like to live in Natick, MA and looking to find an apartment in a place they will like to live. The location can be manipulated easily and one can use this project for any location.
